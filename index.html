			<p id="p01">"Yes, I am a pirate 200 years too late!  Kyle, a long-time Jimmy Buffett fan, can relate.  Kyle grew up near the Chesapeake Bay sailing, crabbing and spending hours on the beach. After graduating from college in 2004, Kyle joined the US Navy, serving for almost six years and and crossing the entire world by water.  Since leaving full-time sea duty in 2014, Kyle achieved two great feats for a mariner's resume: he learned to navigate by the stars and crossed a major sea by sail.  Learning these new skills required Kyle to take three and a half weeks of vacation from his new consulting job, but he was determined nevertheless.  Through completion of his long journey, Kyle earned his Offshore Captain Certification from the American Sailing Association.  Since, however, Kyle has taken to the island of Manhattan instead.  He now works long days, all for the chance to complete another wild adventure.
